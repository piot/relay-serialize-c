Sent by the client to the server, notifying the relay server that the client wants to listen for incoming connections.

[cols="1,1,2"]
|===
|Type | Name | Description

|U8
|Command
|`relaySerializeCmdListenRequestToServer` (0x07)

|U64
|Guise User SessionID
|Session ID Acquired previously by a Guise server.


|U64
|ApplicationID
|ApplicationID that the listener is running

|U16
|ChannelID
|Which channel the listener is listening to. This is used to allow multiple listeners on one device. Usually zero.

|U8
|RequestID
|The request ID (any number assigned by the client)

|===

=== Listen Response

Sent by the server to the client, in response to the <<Listen Request>>

[cols="1,1,2"]
|===
|Type | Name | Description

|U8
|Command
|`relaySerializeCmdListenResponseToClient` (0x26)

|U64
|ListenerID
|Assigned listener ID

|U64
|ApplicationID
|ApplicationID that the listener is running. Only for extra verification.

|U16
|ChannelID
|The channel the listener wants to listen to. Usually zero. Only for extra verification.

|U8
|RequestID
|The request ID (any number assigned by the client in the <<Listen Request>>)

|===


=== Connect Request

Sent by the client to the server


[cols="1,1,2"]
|===
|Type | Name | Description

|U8
|Command
|`relaySerializeCmdConnectRequestToServer` (0x06)

|U64
|Guise User SessionID
|The Initiators User Session ID (Acquired previously from a Guise server).

|U64
|Guise UserID
|Guise User ID that the initiator wants to connect to

|U64
|ApplicationID
|The application ID for the listener the initiator wants to connect to.

|U16
|ChannelID
|The channelID of the listener that the initator wants to connect to. In many cases zero.

|U8
|RequestID
|The request ID (any number assigned by the client)

|===


=== Connect Response

Sent by the server to the initiator client, in response of a <<Connect Request>>

[cols="1,1,2"]
|===
|Type | Name | Description

|U8
|Command
|`relaySerializeCmdConnectResponseToClient` (0x27)

|U64
|ConnectionID
|The assigned connectionID by the relay server.

|U8
|RequestID
|The request ID (any number assigned by the client)

|===


=== Connection Request to Listener

Sent from server to listener client. The listener approves the connectionID by sending a packet on that connection.

NOTE: TODO: Should implement a close connection request from the listener. This is needed to minimize unnecessary packets sent to listener from the server for a rejected/closed connection.

|Type | Name | Description

|U8
|Command
|`relaySerializeCmdConnectionRequestToClient` (0x25)

|U64
|ListenerID
|The target listener

|U64
|ConnectionID
|The assigned connectionID by the relay server for the initiator to/from the specified listener.

|U64
|UserID
|The userID of the initiator
